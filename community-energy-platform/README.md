## Project Overview

The Community Energy Sharing Platform is a peer-to-peer energy trading simulation that enables households with solar panels to share excess energy with their neighbors. Our platform creates a local energy marketplace where clean energy producers can sell directly to consumers, reducing dependency on the central grid and creating economic benefits for community members.

## Key Features

- **Real-time Energy Monitoring**: Visualize energy production and consumption for each household
- **P2P Energy Marketplace**: Enable direct trading between neighbors with excess energy and those who need it
- **Dynamic Pricing Algorithm**: Simulate market-based pricing based on supply and demand
- **Community Dashboard**: Track community-wide energy metrics and environmental impact
- **Network Visualization**: Interactive display of energy flows between community members

## Technology Stack

- React.js for the frontend UI
- Recharts for data visualization
- CSS for styling
- Simulated energy production/consumption models
- Energy trading algorithms

## Project Status

This project is currently in the prototype phase. We have implemented:
- Core simulation engine for energy production and consumption
- Basic marketplace functionality for energy trading
- Interactive visualizations of the community energy network
- Dashboard with key metrics and analytics

Next steps include:
- Enhancing the trading algorithm with machine learning
- Adding user authentication and profiles
- Implementing blockchain-based transaction ledger
- Creating a mobile application for real-time monitoring
